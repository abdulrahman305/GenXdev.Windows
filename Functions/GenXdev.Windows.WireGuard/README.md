# WireGuard VPN Management Functions

![WireGuard Logo](https://www.wireguard.com/img/wireguard.svg)

## Overview

This module provides PowerShell functions to manage a WireGuard VPN server running in a Docker container. WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It's designed to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec while avoiding the massive headache.

## Quick Start

```powershell
# Ensure the WireGuard server is running
EnsureWireGuard

# Add a new peer (client)
Add-WireGuardPeer -PeerName "MyPhone"

# Show QR code for a peer (for mobile device setup)
Get-WireGuardPeerQRCode -PeerNumber 1

# List all configured peers
Get-WireGuardPeers

# Remove a peer by name
Remove-WireGuardPeer -PeerName "MyPhone"
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- PowerShell 5.1 or later (PowerShell Core is also supported)
- Network port 51839/UDP available and forwarded (if used behind NAT)
- WireGuard client app installed on devices you want to connect

## WireGuard vs Traditional VPNs

WireGuard offers several advantages over traditional VPNs:

- **Simple**: The codebase is minimal (~4,000 lines vs. 400,000+ for OpenVPN)
- **Fast**: Significantly faster than OpenVPN and IPsec
- **Secure**: Uses modern cryptography protocols by default
- **Lightweight**: Minimal CPU usage and battery impact on mobile devices
- **Stable**: Connection remains stable during network changes or sleep

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `EnsureWireGuard`              | Ensures the WireGuard server container is running |
| `Add-WireGuardPeer`            | Adds a new peer (client) configuration            |
| `Get-WireGuardPeerQRCode`      | Generates a QR code for easy mobile client setup  |
| `Get-WireGuardPeers`           | Lists all configured peers                        |
| `Remove-WireGuardPeer`         | Removes a peer configuration                      |
| `Reset-WireGuardConfiguration` | Resets the WireGuard configuration                |

## Detailed Usage

### Setting up the WireGuard Server

```powershell
# Basic setup with default settings
EnsureWireGuard

# Custom setup with specific port and container name
EnsureWireGuard -ContainerName "my_wireguard" -ServicePort 51821
```

### Managing Peers (Clients)

```powershell
# Add a new peer with default settings
Add-WireGuardPeer -PeerName "Laptop"

# Add a peer with custom allowed IPs
Add-WireGuardPeer -PeerName "Phone" -AllowedIPs "10.13.13.2/32"

# Generate a QR code for easy setup on mobile devices
Get-WireGuardPeerQRCode -PeerNumber 1

# List all peers
Get-WireGuardPeers

# Remove a peer
Remove-WireGuardPeer -PeerName "OldDevice"
```

## Client Setup

### Android

1. Install the [WireGuard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android) from Google Play Store
2. Use `Get-WireGuardPeerQRCode` to generate a QR code
3. In the WireGuard app, tap "+" and select "Scan from QR code"
4. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal
5. Tap "Create Tunnel" and activate the VPN connection

### iOS

1. Install the [WireGuard app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209) from App Store
2. Use `Get-WireGuardPeerQRCode` to generate a QR code
3. In the WireGuard app, tap "+" and select "Create from QR code"
4. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal
5. Activate the VPN connection

### Windows/macOS/Linux

1. Download and install the [WireGuard client](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)
2. Use `Add-WireGuardPeer` to generate a configuration file
3. Import the generated .conf file into the WireGuard client
4. Activate the VPN connection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Connection Timeouts**: Make sure port 51839/UDP is open in your firewall and forwarded in your router
- **Client Can't Connect**: Verify the endpoint IP address matches your server's public IP
- **Configuration Errors**: Check for proper configuration by examining the peer details
- **Docker Issues**: Ensure Docker is running and that the container has the necessary permissions

### Logs and Diagnostics

To view the WireGuard server logs:

```powershell
docker logs wireguard
```
