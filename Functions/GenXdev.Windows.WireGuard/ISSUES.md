# PowerShell Module Critique: GenXdev.Windows.WireGuard

## Overview
This document provides a detailed critique and practical improvement tips for the PowerShell module located at `Modules/GenXdev.Windows/1.258.2025/Functions/GenXdev.Windows.WireGuard`. The focus is on code quality, maintainability, and compliance with the provided 23-point requirements checklist. The primary function targeted for improvement is `$CmdletName` in `$ScriptFileName`.

---

## General Observations
- The module structure is clear, with each cmdlet/function in its own file.
- README.md is present, but could benefit from more usage examples and troubleshooting tips.
- No obvious security issues detected, but error handling can be improved in some scripts.

---

## Practical Tips for Improvement

1. **Parameter Formatting & Documentation**
   - Ensure every parameter block is preceded by a line of 80 `#` characters.
   - Add/verify a `<# #>` meta section with SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, .PARAMETER, and .EXAMPLE(s) for each function.
   - Strictly enforce 80-character line length in all help and code.
   - Align all parameter attributes vertically, each on its own line.
   - Add/verify `HelpMessage` for every parameter.
   - Switch parameters should always come last and never have a position set.

2. **Function Structure**
   - Every function must have `begin {}`, `process {}`, and `end {}` blocks, even if empty.
   - Insert exactly one empty line after each opening curly brace `{`.
   - Never place empty lines before closing curly braces `}`.
   - Add plain-English code comments above all non-trivial code lines.
   - Ensure code comments alone explain the function's logic.

3. **Pipeline & Output**
   - Always place new lines after `|` pipeline symbols and after parameters using back-tick wraps.
   - Never use back-ticks to wrap dot-separated or concatenated strings.
   - Remove unnecessary `| Out-Null`; use `$null = ...` for ArrayList additions.

4. **Parameter Attributes**
   - If no parameter set names or positional attributes are used, consider adding them for usability (except for switches).
   - Never add, remove, or rename parameters or their attributes unless correcting errors.
   - Use validation attributes where appropriate.

5. **Best Practices**
   - Use `[System.IO]` routines for file operations, but use `GenXdev.FileSystem\Expand-Path` instead of `[System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath`.
   - Use `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Verbose` for essential messages.
   - Internal variables should start with lowercase; parameters with uppercase.
   - Enforce line wrapping for all code and help to 80 characters.

6. **Error Handling & Technical Debt**
   - Add error handling for all external calls and file operations.
   - Remove technical debt such as commented-out code, unused variables, or legacy patterns.
   - Fix any spelling or language errors in code and documentation.

7. **Compliance**
   - Ensure all 23 requirements are met for every function and parameter.
   - If any requirement cannot be met, document the reason clearly.

## Example Refactoring Checklist
1. File starts and ends with 80 `#` characters.
2. Each parameter/function block is separated by a line of 79 `#` characters.
3. Meta help section is present and strictly 80 characters wide.
4. All parameter attributes are vertically aligned and complete.
5. Function has begin, process, and end blocks with correct spacing.
6. Code comments explain all non-trivial logic.
7. No unnecessary `| Out-Null` or back-tick misuse.
8. All lines (code and help) are wrapped at 80 characters.
9. No parameter or alias changes unless correcting errors.
10. All best practices and error handling are applied.

---

## Next Steps
- Refactor `$CmdletName` in `$ScriptFileName` according to the above tips.
- Run unit tests using `Assert-GenXdevTest` after making changes.
- Offer changelog entries summarizing improvements.
